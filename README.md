# Forest-Fire-Prediction-Project
Predicting which machine learning and deep learning algorithm give better accuracy result.
Here I have used two machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Classifer(RF) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN),
And two deep learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional neural network (CNN).
The dataset that has been used is Test dataset and Train dataset,
The model gives us accuracy, confusion matrix, time complexity and space complexity.
